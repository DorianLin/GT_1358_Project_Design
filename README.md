### Project Introduction
The project is a mobile application for mental health and risk stratification based on neighborhood characteristics for both Apple and Android platforms. Virtually no research exists examining the daily influence of environmental factors on the development of mental health disorders such as schizophrenia. Our solution is a mobile app that collects real-time data (daily survey) on the status of the userâ€™s mental health such as their feelings and emotions in relation to their location during the day. We can compile and organize this data into a database for our client and other clinicians to analyze and can better treat their own patients and gain knowledge of the development of mental health disorders.
